# TweetCollage
**A picture is worth 1000 characters.**
**TweetCollege** harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to create art from your tweets!

## The Stack
*Here's an overview of what's happening under the hood:*
* Gulp compiles Less
* React and Router renders the frontend
* IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding extracts keywords from tweets
* MongoDB holds the data
* Bing API provides the images
* Canvas composes the collages
* Twitter API brings in the tweets and enables the bot

## Setup
* **In the root of this directory**: Run `npm install` to download dependencies.
* Run `gulp` to monitor the src/client/less folder for changes and to compile index.css and App.css.
